                Kosambari Salad is a South Indian tempered salad, typically from the state of Karnataka. It is primarily made with lentils 
                or pulses with a tempering of basic South Indian spices and curry leaves.
                An authentic Kosambari is always quick to make, simple, fuss-free, yet is tasty, wholesome and a great way of adding some 
                extra proteins in your diet or meals.
                While this salad perfectly goes with your main meals, you can even have it as a snack, just like it is had in South India.

                It is made with fresh okra (lady's finger) stir-fried with grated coconut, curry leaves, green chilies, and a mild tempering 
                of mustard seeds and urad dal. Unlike gravies, ajadina refers to a dry preparation, where the vegetables are lightly sautéed 
                with minimal spices, allowing their natural taste to shine.
                This dish is light, healthy, and satvik (no onion or garlic), reflecting the essence of Udupi temple cuisine. It is usually served 
                as part of a traditional South Indian meal, alongside rice, sambar, rasam, and papad. The fresh coconut adds sweetness, while the tempered 
                spices enhance aroma, making it a comforting and homely dish.

                Meen Saar is a traditional fish curry from coastal Karnataka, especially popular in Udupi and Mangalore households. 
                The word "Saar" means a thin curry or rasam-like broth. Freshly caught coastal fish is simmered in a base of tamarind, 
                red chilies, and ground spices, creating a tangy, mildly spiced curry that pairs perfectly with steamed rice. Unlike thicker 
                gravies, Meen Saar is light, aromatic, and easy to digest. The flavor of the fish blends beautifully with the coastal spice mix, 
                making it a staple comfort dish for seafood lovers in the region.

                Uppad Pachir is a traditional Udupi raita, prepared by mixing fresh vegetables or greens with creamy yogurt and a light tempering of 
                mustard seeds, curry leaves, and green chilies. The name "uppad" refers to salt, and "pachir" refers to a fresh side dish, often cooling
                and refreshing. This dish is mildly spiced, soothing, and balances the heat of the main curries and sambar in a Udupi meal. It is usually 
                served as an accompaniment to rice, making the overall meal wholesome and satisfying.
